Project Overview:
An AI-powered application built with Python, Flask, and Google's Vertex AI that dynamically generates customized quiz questions in JSON format.
This service allows users to generate unique content by specifying the topic, difficulty, and language via simple URL parameters.
This project serves as a minimal, yet powerful, microservice for educational content generation.
It addresses the need for quick, adaptable, and diverse quiz content by integrating a large language model (LLM) through the Vertex AI API.
